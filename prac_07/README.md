## Lessons Learned about Clean Code
In this subject, I've learned several important lessons about writing clean and maintainable code:
1. **Meaningful Variable Names:** Using descriptive and meaningful variable names can make code more readable and self-explanatory.
2. **Code Formatting:** Consistent code formatting, such as indentation and spacing, improves code readability and maintainability.
3. **Modularization:** Breaking code into smaller, reusable functions or modules helps in keeping code clean and easy to manage.
