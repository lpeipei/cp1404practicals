# Reflection on Practical Tasks

## Task Estimations and Accuracy
Throughout the course, at first, the accuracy of my estimates was somewhat lacking as I often underestimated the complexity of the tasks. However, as the course progressed, I began to have a better idea of the time required for certain tasks and my estimates became more accurate.
## Code Reviews

When my code was reviewed, I received constructive feedback that helped me identify and correct problems that I might not have noticed on my own. On the other hand, when I review code submitted by my peers, I am able to learn different approaches to solving problems

## Suggestions for Improvement

Looking back on the practical tasks and the course as a whole, there are a few areas I would consider for improvement if I were in charge:

1. Incorporating real-world scenarios and industry-standard tools and practices into the practical tasks could further prepare students for professional software development.
